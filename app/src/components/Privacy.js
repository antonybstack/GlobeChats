            your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
            activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
            standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
            mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
            online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
            the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
            this privacy notice.
